# CasaMöbel

CasaMöbel is a family-owned and operated furniture business and this website was created for the final project of the [Try Kibo Web Foundations](https://kibo.school/classes/web-foundations/) - July 2022 program.

## About

The main focus of CasaMöbel is to create elegant and eco-friendly furniture that has minimal impact on the environment, so they can contribute significantly to the care of our planet.

The CasaMöbel homepage is a basic webpage which was created using the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project shows the application of the skills learnt during the course of the Try Kibo program.
